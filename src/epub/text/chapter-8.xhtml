			<h2>CHAPTER VIII.The Escape from Opar</h2>
			<p>Werper was astounded. Could this creature be the same dignified Englishman whohad entertained him so graciously in his luxurious African home? Could thiswild beast, with blazing eyes, and bloody countenance, be at the same time aman? Could the horrid, victory cry he had but just heard have been formed inhuman throat?</p>
			<p>Tarzan was eyeing the man and the woman, a puzzled expression in his eyes, butthere was no faintest tinge of recognition. It was as though he had discoveredsome new species of living creature and was marveling at his find.</p>
			<p>La was studying the ape-man’s features. Slowly her large eyes opened verywide.</p>
			<p>“Tarzan!” she exclaimed, and then, in the vernacular of the greatapes which constant association with the anthropoids had rendered the commonlanguage of the Oparians: “You have come back to me! La has ignored themandates of her religion, waiting, always waiting for Tarzan⁠—for herTarzan. She has taken no mate, for in all the world there was but one with whomLa would mate. And now you have come back! Tell me, O Tarzan, that it is for meyou have returned.”</p>
			<p>Werper listened to the unintelligible jargon. He looked from La to Tarzan.Would the latter understand this strange tongue? To the Belgian’ssurprise, the Englishman answered in a language evidently identical to hers.</p>
			<p>“Tarzan,” he repeated, musingly. “Tarzan. The name soundsfamiliar.”</p>
			<p>“It is your name⁠—you are Tarzan,” cried La.</p>
			<p>“I am Tarzan?” The ape-man shrugged. “Well, it is a goodname⁠—I know no other, so I will keep it; but I do not know you. I did notcome hither for you. Why I came, I do not know at all; neither do I know fromwhence I came. Can you tell me?”</p>
			<p>La shook her head. “I never knew,” she replied.</p>
			<p>Tarzan turned toward Werper and put the same question to him; but in thelanguage of the great apes. The Belgian shook his head.</p>
			<p>“I do not understand that language,” he said in French.</p>
			<p>Without effort, and apparently without realizing that he made the change,Tarzan repeated his question in French. Werper suddenly came to a fullrealization of the magnitude of the injury of which Tarzan was a victim. Theman had lost his memory⁠—no longer could he recollect past events. TheBelgian was upon the point of enlightening him, when it suddenly occurred tohim that by keeping Tarzan in ignorance, for a time at least, of his trueidentity, it might be possible to turn the ape-man’s misfortune to hisown advantage.</p>
			<p>“I cannot tell you from whence you came,” he said; “but thisI can tell you⁠—if we do not get out of this horrible place we shall bothbe slain upon this bloody altar. The woman was about to plunge her knife intomy heart when the lion interrupted the fiendish ritual. Come! Before theyrecover from their fright and reassemble, let us find a way out of theirdamnable temple.”</p>
			<p>Tarzan turned again toward La.</p>
			<p>“Why,” he asked, “would you have killed this man? Are youhungry?”</p>
			<p>The High Priestess cried out in disgust.</p>
			<p>“Did he attempt to kill you?” continued Tarzan.</p>
			<p>The woman shook her head.</p>
			<p>“Then why should you have wished to kill him?” Tarzan wasdetermined to get to the bottom of the thing.</p>
			<p>La raised her slender arm and pointed toward the sun.</p>
			<p>“We were offering up his soul as a gift to the Flaming God,” shesaid.</p>
			<p>Tarzan looked puzzled. He was again an ape, and apes do not understand suchmatters as souls and Flaming Gods.</p>
			<p>“Do you wish to die?” he asked Werper.</p>
			<p>The Belgian assured him, with tears in his eyes, that he did not wish to die.</p>
			<p>“Very well then, you shall not,” said Tarzan. “Come! We willgo. This SHE would kill you and keep me for herself. It is no place anyway fora Mangani. I should soon die, shut up behind these stone walls.”</p>
			<p>He turned toward La. “We are going now,” he said.</p>
			<p>The woman rushed forward and seized the ape-man’s hands in hers.</p>
			<p>“Do not leave me!” she cried. “Stay, and you shall be HighPriest. La loves you. All Opar shall be yours. Slaves shall wait upon you.Stay, Tarzan of the Apes, and let love reward you.”</p>
			<p>The ape-man pushed the kneeling woman aside. “Tarzan does not desireyou,” he said, simply, and stepping to Werper’s side he cut theBelgian’s bonds and motioned him to follow.</p>
			<p>Panting⁠—her face convulsed with rage, La sprang to her feet.</p>
			<p>“Stay, you shall!” she screamed. “La will have you⁠—ifshe cannot have you alive, she will have you dead,” and raising her faceto the sun she gave voice to the same hideous shriek that Werper had heard oncebefore and Tarzan many times.</p>
			<p>In answer to her cry a babel of voices broke from the surrounding chambers andcorridors.</p>
			<p>“Come, Guardian Priests!” she cried. “The infidels haveprofaned the holiest of the holies. Come! Strike terror to their hearts; defendLa and her altar; wash clean the temple with the blood of the polluters.”</p>
			<p>Tarzan understood, though Werper did not. The former glanced at the Belgian andsaw that he was unarmed. Stepping quickly to La’s side the ape-man seizedher in his strong arms and though she fought with all the mad savagery of ademon, he soon disarmed her, handing her long, sacrificial knife to Werper.</p>
			<p>“You will need this,” he said, and then from each doorway a hordeof the monstrous, little men of Opar streamed into the temple.</p>
			<p>They were armed with bludgeons and knives, and fortified in their courage byfanatical hate and frenzy. Werper was terrified. Tarzan stood eyeing the foe inproud disdain. Slowly he advanced toward the exit he had chosen to utilize inmaking his way from the temple. A burly priest barred his way. Behind the firstwas a score of others. Tarzan swung his heavy spear, clublike, down upon theskull of the priest. The fellow collapsed, his head crushed.</p>
			<p>Again and again the weapon fell as Tarzan made his way slowly toward thedoorway. Werper pressed close behind, casting backward glances toward theshrieking, dancing mob menacing their rear. He held the sacrificial knife readyto strike whoever might come within its reach; but none came. For a time hewondered that they should so bravely battle with the giant ape-man, yethesitate to rush upon him, who was relatively so weak. Had they done so he knewthat he must have fallen at the first charge. Tarzan had reached the doorwayover the corpses of all that had stood to dispute his way, before Werperguessed at the reason for his immunity. The priests feared the sacrificialknife! Willingly would they face death and welcome it if it came while theydefended their High Priestess and her altar; but evidently there were deaths,and deaths. Some strange superstition must surround that polished blade, thatno Oparian cared to chance a death thrust from it, yet gladly rushed to theslaughter of the ape-man’s flaying spear.</p>
			<p>Once outside the temple court, Werper communicated his discovery to Tarzan. Theape-man grinned, and let Werper go before him, brandishing the jeweled and holyweapon. Like leaves before a gale, the Oparians scattered in all directions andTarzan and the Belgian found a clear passage through the corridors and chambersof the ancient temple.</p>
			<p>The Belgian’s eyes went wide as they passed through the room of the sevenpillars of solid gold. With ill-concealed avarice he looked upon the age-old,golden tablets set in the walls of nearly every room and down the sides of manyof the corridors. To the ape-man all this wealth appeared to mean nothing.</p>
			<p>On the two went, chance leading them toward the broad avenue which lay betweenthe stately piles of the half-ruined edifices and the inner wall of the city.Great apes jabbered at them and menaced them; but Tarzan answered them aftertheir own kind, giving back taunt for taunt, insult for insult, challenge forchallenge.</p>
			<p>Werper saw a hairy bull swing down from a broken column and advance,stiff-legged and bristling, toward the naked giant. The yellow fangs werebared, angry snarls and barkings rumbled threateningly through the thick andhanging lips.</p>
			<p>The Belgian watched his companion. To his horror, he saw the man stoop untilhis closed knuckles rested upon the ground as did those of the anthropoid. Hesaw him circle, stiff-legged about the circling ape. He heard the same bestialbarkings and growlings issue from the human throat that were coming from themouth of the brute. Had his eyes been closed he could not have known but thattwo giant apes were bridling for combat.</p>
			<p>But there was no battle. It ended as the majority of such jungle encountersend⁠—one of the boasters loses his nerve, and becomes suddenly interestedin a blowing leaf, a beetle, or the lice upon his hairy stomach.</p>
			<p>In this instance it was the anthropoid that retired in stiff dignity to inspectan unhappy caterpillar, which he presently devoured. For a moment Tarzan seemedinclined to pursue the argument. He swaggered truculently, stuck out his chest,roared and advanced closer to the bull. It was with difficulty that Werperfinally persuaded him to leave well enough alone and continue his way from theancient city of the Sun Worshipers.</p>
			<p>The two searched for nearly an hour before they found the narrow exit throughthe inner wall. From there the well-worn trail led them beyond the outerfortification to the desolate valley of Opar.</p>
			<p>Tarzan had no idea, in so far as Werper could discover, as to where he was orwhence he came. He wandered aimlessly about, searching for food, which hediscovered beneath small rocks, or hiding in the shade of the scant brush whichdotted the ground.</p>
			<p>The Belgian was horrified by the hideous menu of his companion. Beetles,rodents and caterpillars were devoured with seeming relish. Tarzan was indeedan ape again.</p>
			<p>At last Werper succeeded in leading his companion toward the distant hillswhich mark the northwestern boundary of the valley, and together the two setout in the direction of the Greystoke bungalow.</p>
			<p>What purpose prompted the Belgian in leading the victim of his treachery andgreed back toward his former home it is difficult to guess, unless it was thatwithout Tarzan there could be no ransom for Tarzan’s wife.</p>
			<p>That night they camped in the valley beyond the hills, and as they sat before alittle fire where cooked a wild pig that had fallen to one of Tarzan’sarrows, the latter sat lost in speculation. He seemed continually to be tryingto grasp some mental image which as constantly eluded him.</p>
			<p>At last he opened the leathern pouch which hung at his side. From it he pouredinto the palm of his hand a quantity of glittering gems. The firelight playingupon them conjured a multitude of scintillating rays, and as the wide eyes ofthe Belgian looked on in rapt fascination, the man’s expression at lastacknowledged a tangible purpose in courting the society of the ape-man.</p>
