			<p>Lieutenant Albert Werper had only the prestige of the name he had dishonored tothank for his narrow escape from being cashiered. At first he had been humblythankful, too, that they had sent him to this Godforsaken Congo post instead ofcourt-martialing him, as he had so justly deserved; but now six months of themonotony, the frightful isolation and the loneliness had wrought a change. Theyoung man brooded continually over his fate. His days were filled with morbidself-pity, which eventually engendered in his weak and vacillating mind ahatred for those who had sent him here⁠—for the very men he had at firstinwardly thanked for saving him from the ignominy of degradation.</p>
			<p>He regretted the gay life of Brussels as he never had regretted the sins whichhad snatched him from that gayest of capitals, and as the days passed he cameto center his resentment upon the representative in Congo land of the authoritywhich had exiled him⁠—his captain and immediate superior.</p>
			<p>This officer was a cold, taciturn man, inspiring little love in those directlybeneath him, yet respected and feared by the black soldiers of his littlecommand.</p>
			<p>Werper was accustomed to sit for hours glaring at his superior as the two satupon the veranda of their common quarters, smoking their evening cigarets in asilence which neither seemed desirous of breaking. The senseless hatred of thelieutenant grew at last into a form of mania. The captain’s naturaltaciturnity he distorted into a studied attempt to insult him because of hispast shortcomings. He imagined that his superior held him in contempt, and sohe chafed and fumed inwardly until one evening his madness became suddenlyhomicidal. He fingered the butt of the revolver at his hip, his eyes narrowedand his brows contracted. At last he spoke.</p>
			<p>“You have insulted me for the last time!” he cried, springing tohis feet. “I am an officer and a gentleman, and I shall put up with it nolonger without an accounting from you, you pig.”</p>
			<p>The captain, an expression of surprise upon his features, turned toward hisjunior. He had seen men before with the jungle madness upon them⁠—themadness of solitude and unrestrained brooding, and perhaps a touch of fever.</p>
			<p>He rose and extended his hand to lay it upon the other’s shoulder. Quietwords of counsel were upon his lips; but they were never spoken. Werperconstrued his superior’s action into an attempt to close with him. Hisrevolver was on a level with the captain’s heart, and the latter hadtaken but a step when Werper pulled the trigger. Without a moan the man sank tothe rough planking of the veranda, and as he fell the mists that had cloudedWerper’s brain lifted, so that he saw himself and the deed that he haddone in the same light that those who must judge him would see them.</p>
			<p>He heard excited exclamations from the quarters of the soldiers and he heardmen running in his direction. They would seize him, and if they didn’tkill him they would take him down the Congo to a point where a properly orderedmilitary tribunal would do so just as effectively, though in a more regularmanner.</p>
			<p>Werper had no desire to die. Never before had he so yearned for life as in thismoment that he had so effectively forfeited his right to live. The men werenearing him. What was he to do? He glanced about as though searching for thetangible form of a legitimate excuse for his crime; but he could find only thebody of the man he had so causelessly shot down.</p>
			<p>In despair, he turned and fled from the oncoming soldiery. Across the compoundhe ran, his revolver still clutched tightly in his hand. At the gates a sentryhalted him. Werper did not pause to parley or to exert the influence of hiscommission⁠—he merely raised his weapon and shot down the innocent black.A moment later the fugitive had torn open the gates and vanished into theblackness of the jungle, but not before he had transferred the rifle andammunition belts of the dead sentry to his own person.</p>
			<p>All that night Werper fled farther and farther into the heart of the wilderness. Now and again the voice of a lion brought him to a listening halt; but with cocked and ready rifle he pushed ahead again, more fearful of the human huntsmen in his rear than of the wild carnivora ahead.</p>
			<p>Dawn came at last, but still the man plodded on. All sense of hunger andfatigue were lost in the terrors of contemplated capture. He could think onlyof escape. He dared not pause to rest or eat until there was no further dangerfrom pursuit, and so he staggered on until at last he fell and could rise nomore. How long he had fled he did not know, or try to know. When he could fleeno longer the knowledge that he had reached his limit was hidden from him inthe unconsciousness of utter exhaustion.</p>
			<p>And thus it was that Achmet Zek, the Arab, found him. Achmet’s followerswere for running a spear through the body of their hereditary enemy; but Achmetwould have it otherwise. First he would question the Belgian. It were easier toquestion a man first and kill him afterward, than kill him first and thenquestion him.</p>
			<p>So he had Lieutenant Albert Werper carried to his own tent, and there slavesadministered wine and food in small quantities until at last the prisonerregained consciousness. As he opened his eyes he saw the faces of strange blackmen about him, and just outside the tent the figure of an Arab. Nowhere was theuniform of his soldiers to be seen.</p>
			<p>The Arab turned and seeing the open eyes of the prisoner upon him, entered thetent.</p>
			<p>“I am Achmet Zek,” he announced. “Who are you, and what wereyou doing in my country? Where are your soldiers?”</p>
			<p>Achmet Zek! Werper’s eyes went wide, and his heart sank. He was in the clutches of the most notorious of cutthroats⁠—a hater of all Europeans, especially those who wore the uniform of Belgium. For years the military forcesof Belgian Congo had waged a fruitless war upon this man and hisfollowers⁠—a war in which quarter had never been asked nor expected byeither side.</p>
			<p>But presently in the very hatred of the man for Belgians, Werper saw a faintray of hope for himself. He, too, was an outcast and an outlaw. So far, atleast, they possessed a common interest, and Werper decided to play upon it forall that it might yield.</p>
			<p>“I have heard of you,” he replied, “and was searching foryou. My people have turned against me. I hate them. Even now their soldiers aresearching for me, to kill me. I knew that you would protect me from them, foryou, too, hate them. In return I will take service with you. I am a trainedsoldier. I can fight, and your enemies are my enemies.”</p>
			<p>Achmet Zek eyed the European in silence. In his mind he revolved many thoughts, chief among which was that the unbeliever lied. Of course there was the chance that he did not lie, and if he told the truth then his proposition was one well worthy of consideration, since fighting men were never overplentiful⁠—especially white men with the training and knowledge of military matters that a European officer must possess.</p>
			<p>Achmet Zek scowled and Werper’s heart sank; but Werper did not knowAchmet Zek, who was quite apt to scowl where another would smile, and smilewhere another would scowl.</p>
			<p>“And if you have lied to me,” said Achmet Zek, “I will killyou at any time. What return, other than your life, do you expect for yourservices?”</p>
			<p>“My keep only, at first,” replied Werper. “Later, if I amworth more, we can easily reach an understanding.” Werper’s onlydesire at the moment was to preserve his life. And so the agreement was reachedand Lieutenant Albert Werper became a member of the ivory and slave raidingband of the notorious Achmet Zek.</p>
			<p>For months the renegade Belgian rode with the savage raider. He fought with a savage abandon, and a vicious cruelty fully equal to that of his fellow desperadoes. Achmet Zek watched his recruit with eagle eye, and with a growing satisfaction which finally found expression in a greater confidence in the man, and resulted in an increased independence of action for Werper.</p>
			<p>Achmet Zek took the Belgian into his confidence to a great extent, and at last unfolded to him a pet scheme which the Arab had long fostered, but which henever had found an opportunity to effect. With the aid of a European, however, the thing might be easily accomplished. He sounded Werper.</p>
			<p>“You have heard of the man men call Tarzan?” he asked.</p>
			<p>Werper nodded. “I have heard of him; but I do not know him.”</p>
			<p>“But for him we might carry on our ‘trading’ in safety andwith great profit,” continued the Arab. “For years he has foughtus, driving us from the richest part of the country, harassing us, and armingthe natives that they may repel us when we come to ‘trade.’ He isvery rich. If we could find some way to make him pay us many pieces of gold weshould not only be avenged upon him; but repaid for much that he has preventedus from winning from the natives under his protection.”</p>
			<p>Werper withdrew a cigaret from a jeweled case and lighted it.</p>
			<p>“And you have a plan to make him pay?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“He has a wife,” replied Achmet Zek, “whom men say is verybeautiful. She would bring a great price farther north, if we found it toodifficult to collect ransom money from this Tarzan.”</p>
			<p>Werper bent his head in thought. Achmet Zek stood awaiting his reply. What goodremained in Albert Werper revolted at the thought of selling a white woman intothe slavery and degradation of a Muslim harem. He looked up at Achmet Zek. Hesaw the Arab’s eyes narrow, and he guessed that the other had sensed hisantagonism to the plan. What would it mean to Werper to refuse? His life lay inthe hands of this semi-barbarian, who esteemed the life of an unbeliever lesshighly than that of a dog. Werper loved life. What was this woman to him, anyway? She was a European, doubtless, a member of organized society. He was anoutcast. The hand of every white man was against him. She was his naturalenemy, and if he refused to lend himself to her undoing, Achmet Zek would havehim killed.</p>
			<p>“You hesitate,” murmured the Arab.</p>
			<p>“I was but weighing the chances of success,” lied Werper, “and my reward. As a European I can gain admittance to their home and table. You have no other with you who could do so much. The risk will be great.I should be well paid, Achmet Zek.”</p>
			<p>A smile of relief passed over the raider’s face.</p>
			<p>“Well said, Werper,” and Achmet Zek slapped his lieutenant upon theshoulder. “You should be well paid and you shall. Now let us sit togetherand plan how best the thing may be done,” and the two men squatted upon asoft rug beneath the faded silks of Achmet’s once gorgeous tent, andtalked together in low voices well into the night. Both were tall and bearded, and the exposure to sun and wind had given an almost Arab hue to theEuropean’s complexion. In every detail of dress, too, he copied thefashions of his chief, so that outwardly he was as much an Arab as the other.It was late when he arose and retired to his own tent.</p>
			<p>The following day Werper spent in overhauling his Belgian uniform, removingfrom it every vestige of evidence that might indicate its military purposes.From a heterogeneous collection of loot, Achmet Zek procured a pith helmet anda European saddle, and from his black slaves and followers a party of porters, askaris and tent boys to make up a modest safari for a big game hunter. At thehead of this party Werper set out from camp.</p>
