				<h3 epub:type="title">The Arab Raid</h3>
			</hgroup>
			<p>After their first terror had subsided subsequent to the shock of theearthquake, Basuli and his warriors hastened back into the passageway in searchof Tarzan and two of their own number who were also missing.</p>
			<p>They found the way blocked by jammed and distorted rock. For two days theylabored to tear a way through to their imprisoned friends; but when, afterHerculean efforts, they had unearthed but a few yards of the choked passage,and discovered the mangled remains of one of their fellows they were forced tothe conclusion that Tarzan and the second Waziri also lay dead beneath the rockmass farther in, beyond human aid, and no longer susceptible of it.</p>
			<p>Again and again as they labored they called aloud the names of their master andtheir comrade; but no answering call rewarded their listening ears. At lastthey gave up the search. Tearfully they cast a last look at the shattered tombof their master, shouldered the heavy burden of gold that would at leastfurnish comfort, if not happiness, to their bereaved and beloved mistress, andmade their mournful way back across the desolate valley of Opar, and downwardthrough the forests beyond toward the distant bungalow.</p>
			<p>And as they marched what sorry fate was already drawing down upon thatpeaceful, happy home!</p>
			<p>From the north came Achmet Zek, riding to the summons of his lieutenant’sletter. With him came his horde of renegade Arabs, outlawed marauders, these,and equally degraded blacks, garnered from the more debased and ignorant tribesof savage cannibals through whose countries the raider passed to and fro withperfect impunity.</p>
			<p>Mugambi, the ebon Hercules, who had shared the dangers and vicissitudes of hisbeloved Bwana, from Jungle Island, almost to the headwaters of the Ugambi, wasthe first to note the bold approach of the sinister caravan.</p>
			<p>He it was whom Tarzan had left in charge of the warriors who remained to guardLady Greystoke, nor could a braver or more loyal guardian have been found inany clime or upon any soil. A giant in stature, a savage, fearless warrior, thehuge black possessed also soul and judgment in proportion to his bulk and hisferocity.</p>
			<p>Not once since his master had departed had he been beyond sight or sound of thebungalow, except when Lady Greystoke chose to canter across the broad plain, orrelieve the monotony of her loneliness by a brief hunting excursion. On suchoccasions Mugambi, mounted upon a wiry Arab, had ridden close at herhorse’s heels.</p>
			<p>The raiders were still a long way off when the warrior’s keen eyesdiscovered them. For a time he stood scrutinizing the advancing party insilence, then he turned and ran rapidly in the direction of the native hutswhich lay a few hundred yards below the bungalow.</p>
			<p>Here he called out to the lolling warriors. He issued orders rapidly. Incompliance with them the men seized upon their weapons and their shields. Someran to call in the workers from the fields and to warn the tenders of theflocks and herds. The majority followed Mugambi back toward the bungalow.</p>
			<p>The dust of the raiders was still a long distance away. Mugambi could not knowpositively that it hid an enemy; but he had spent a lifetime of savage life insavage Africa, and he had seen parties before come thus unheralded. Sometimesthey had come in peace and sometimes they had come in war⁠—one could nevertell. It was well to be prepared. Mugambi did not like the haste with which thestrangers advanced.</p>
			<p>The Greystoke bungalow was not well adapted for defense. No palisade surroundedit, for, situated as it was, in the heart of loyal Waziri, its master hadanticipated no possibility of an attack in force by any enemy. Heavy, woodenshutters there were to close the window apertures against hostile arrows, andthese Mugambi was engaged in lowering when Lady Greystoke appeared upon theveranda.</p>
			<p>“Why, Mugambi!” she exclaimed. “What has happened? Why areyou lowering the shutters?”</p>
			<p>Mugambi pointed out across the plain to where a white-robed force of mountedmen was now distinctly visible.</p>
			<p>“Arabs,” he explained. “They come for no good purpose in theabsence of the Great Bwana.”</p>
			<p>Beyond the neat lawn and the flowering shrubs, Jane Clayton saw the glisteningbodies of her Waziri. The sun glanced from the tips of their metal-shod spears,picked out the gorgeous colors in the feathers of their war bonnets, andreflected the highlights from the glossy skins of their broad shoulders andhigh cheek bones.</p>
			<p>Jane Clayton surveyed them with unmixed feelings of pride and affection. Whatharm could befall her with such as these to protect her?</p>
			<p>The raiders had halted now, a hundred yards out upon the plain. Mugambi hadhastened down to join his warriors. He advanced a few yards before them andraising his voice hailed the strangers. Achmet Zek sat straight in his saddlebefore his henchmen.</p>
			<p>“Arab!” cried Mugambi. “What do you here?”</p>
			<p>“We come in peace,” Achmet Zek called back.</p>
			<p>“Then turn and go in peace,” replied Mugambi. “We do not wantyou here. There can be no peace between Arab and Waziri.”</p>
			<p>Mugambi, although not born in Waziri, had been adopted into the tribe, whichnow contained no member more jealous of its traditions and its prowess than he.</p>
			<p>Achmet Zek drew to one side of his horde, speaking to his men in a low voice. Amoment later, without warning, a ragged volley was poured into the ranks of theWaziri. A couple of warriors fell, the others were for charging the attackers;but Mugambi was a cautious as well as a brave leader. He knew the futility ofcharging mounted men armed with muskets. He withdrew his force behind theshrubbery of the garden. Some he dispatched to various other parts of thegrounds surrounding the bungalow. Half a dozen he sent to the bungalow itselfwith instructions to keep their mistress within doors, and to protect her withtheir lives.</p>
			<p>Adopting the tactics of the desert fighters from which he had sprung, AchmetZek led his followers at a gallop in a long, thin line, describing a greatcircle which drew closer and closer in toward the defenders.</p>
			<p>At that part of the circle closest to the Waziri, a constant fusillade of shotswas poured into the bushes behind which the black warriors had concealedthemselves. The latter, on their part, loosed their slim shafts at the nearestof the enemy.</p>
			<p>The Waziri, justly famed for their archery, found no cause to blush for theirperformance that day. Time and again some swarthy horseman threw hands abovehis head and toppled from his saddle, pierced by a deadly arrow; but thecontest was uneven. The Arabs outnumbered the Waziri; their bullets penetratedthe shrubbery and found marks that the Arab riflemen had not even seen; andthen Achmet Zek circled inward a half mile above the bungalow, tore down asection of the fence, and led his marauders within the grounds.</p>
			<p>Across the fields they charged at a mad run. Not again did they pause to lowerfences, instead, they drove their wild mounts straight for them, clearing theobstacles as lightly as winged gulls.</p>
			<p>Mugambi saw them coming, and, calling those of his warriors who remained, ranfor the bungalow and the last stand. Upon the veranda Lady Greystoke stood,rifle in hand. More than a single raider had accounted to her steady nerves andcool aim for his outlawry; more than a single pony raced, riderless, in thewake of the charging horde.</p>
			<p>Mugambi pushed his mistress back into the greater security of the interior, andwith his depleted force prepared to make a last stand against the foe.</p>
			<p>On came the Arabs, shouting and waving their long guns above their heads. Pastthe veranda they raced, pouring a deadly fire into the kneeling Waziri whodischarged their volley of arrows from behind their long, ovalshields⁠—shields well adapted, perhaps, to stop a hostile arrow, ordeflect a spear; but futile, quite, before the leaden missiles of the riflemen.</p>
			<p>From beneath the half-raised shutters of the bungalow other bowmen dideffective service in greater security, and after the first assault, Mugambiwithdrew his entire force within the building.</p>
			<p>Again and again the Arabs charged, at last forming a stationary circle aboutthe little fortress, and outside the effective range of the defenders’arrows. From their new position they fired at will at the windows. One by onethe Waziri fell. Fewer and fewer were the arrows that replied to the guns ofthe raiders, and at last Achmet Zek felt safe in ordering an assault.</p>
			<p>Firing as they ran, the bloodthirsty horde raced for the veranda. A dozen ofthem fell to the arrows of the defenders; but the majority reached the door.Heavy gun butts fell upon it. The crash of splintered wood mingled with thereport of a rifle as Jane Clayton fired through the panels upon the relentlessfoe.</p>
			<p>Upon both sides of the door men fell; but at last the frail barrier gave to thevicious assaults of the maddened attackers; it crumpled inward and a dozenswarthy murderers leaped into the living-room. At the far end stood JaneClayton surrounded by the remnant of her devoted guardians. The floor wascovered by the bodies of those who already had given up their lives in herdefense. In the forefront of her protectors stood the giant Mugambi. The Arabsraised their rifles to pour in the last volley that would effectually end allresistance; but Achmet Zek roared out a warning order that stayed their triggerfingers.</p>
			<p>“Fire not upon the woman!” he cried. “Who harms her, dies.Take the woman alive!”</p>
			<p>The Arabs rushed across the room; the Waziri met them with their heavy spears.Swords flashed, long-barreled pistols roared out their sullen death dooms.Mugambi launched his spear at the nearest of the enemy with a force that drovethe heavy shaft completely through the Arab’s body, then he seized apistol from another, and grasping it by the barrel brained all who forced theirway too near his mistress.</p>
			<p>Emulating his example the few warriors who remained to him fought like demons;but one by one they fell, until only Mugambi remained to defend the life andhonor of the ape-man’s mate.</p>
			<p>From across the room Achmet Zek watched the unequal struggle and urged on hisminions. In his hands was a jeweled musket. Slowly he raised it to hisshoulder, waiting until another move should place Mugambi at his mercy withoutendangering the lives of the woman or any of his own followers.</p>
			<p>At last the moment came, and Achmet Zek pulled the trigger. Without a sound thebrave Mugambi sank to the floor at the feet of Jane Clayton.</p>
			<p>An instant later she was surrounded and disarmed. Without a word they draggedher from the bungalow. A giant Negro lifted her to the pommel of his saddle,and while the raiders searched the bungalow and outhouses for plunder he rodewith her beyond the gates and waited the coming of his master.</p>
			<p>Jane Clayton saw the raiders lead the horses from the corral, and drive theherds in from the fields. She saw her home plundered of all that representedintrinsic worth in the eyes of the Arabs, and then she saw the torch applied,and the flames lick up what remained.</p>
			<p>And at last, when the raiders assembled after glutting their fury and theiravarice, and rode away with her toward the north, she saw the smoke and theflames rising far into the heavens until the winding of the trail into thethick forests hid the sad view from her eyes.</p>
			<p>As the flames ate their way into the living-room, reaching out forked tonguesto lick up the bodies of the dead, one of that gruesome company whose bloodywelterings had long since been stilled, moved again. It was a huge black whorolled over upon his side and opened bloodshot, suffering eyes. Mugambi, whomthe Arabs had left for dead, still lived. The hot flames were almost upon himas he raised himself painfully upon his hands and knees and crawled slowlytoward the doorway.</p>
			<p>Again and again he sank weakly to the floor; but each time he rose again andcontinued his pitiful way toward safety. After what seemed to him aninterminable time, during which the flames had become a veritable fiery furnaceat the far side of the room, the great black managed to reach the veranda, rolldown the steps, and crawl off into the cool safety of some nearby shrubbery.</p>
			<p>All night he lay there, alternately unconscious and painfully sentient; and inthe latter state watching with savage hatred the lurid flames which still rosefrom burning crib and hay cock. A prowling lion roared close at hand; but thegiant black was unafraid. There was place for but a single thought in hissavage mind⁠—revenge! revenge! revenge!</p>
